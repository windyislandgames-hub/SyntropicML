# Scope

SyntropicML is a synthetic knowledge base collection of algorithms that specialize in energy flows, ecosystem succession and regenerative agriculture on the climate of Tinos island and its seasonal cycles, succession stages and long-term ecosystem development. SyntropicML deliverables will be used for building agents that can support decision making, pattern recognition and  predictive modeling that follow key performance indicator : Biomass production rate, Canopy stratification levels, Root system development, Organic matter content, Soil biodiversity, Water retention capacity, Nutrient cycling efficiency, Carbon sequestration rates, Soil structure improvement, Recovery time after disturbance, Pest/disease resistance, Climate adaptation capacity, System self-maintenance level, Resource use efficiency, Energy flow efficiency, Time to system maturity, Resource input requirements, Maintenance needs.

# Roadmap

## Phase 1  : Defining Objectives

### Target Audience :

1. Beginner and experienced gardeners
2. Local residents
3. Tourists
4. AI enthusiasts

### Core Topics :

1. Analyse Principles of syntropic agriculture.
2. Analyse the Climate and soil conditions in Tinos.
3. Evaluate suitable plant species for syntropic systems in Tinos.
4. Evaluate practical techniques (e.g. planting, pruning, mulching).
5. Evaluate water management in a dry climate and engineering solutions (e.g. re-use of blackwater and greywater).
6. Evaluate pest and disease control (natural methods).
7. Develop case studies of successful syntropic gardens in the region.

### Knowledge Base Format :

1. Text
2. Images
3. R.A.G. framework

## Phase 2  : Data Collection

### Gather Existing Information :

1. General research:

- Academic papers and online articles on syntropic agriculture.
- Resources specific to the Mediterranean climate and Greece.

2. Local sources:

- Resources from agricultural experts in Tinos or nearby islands.
- Resources from local farmers, gardeners, and environmental organizations.
- Resources from local libraries, archives, and government resources.

### Conduct Field Research :

1. Visit existing gardens in Tinos:

- Document their design, plant choices, and management practices.
- Take photos and videos.
- Interview the gardeners about their experiences and challenges.

2. Analyze natural vegetation sites in Tinos:

- Study soil types, microclimates, and native vegetation.
- Observe how natural ecosystems function in the area.

## Phase 3  : Content Creation and Fact-Checking

### Develop specific Content :

1. Develop principles of syntropic agriculture in Tinos.
2. Evaluate suitable plant species for syntropic systems in Tinos.
3. Evaluate practical management techniques (e.g. planting, pruning, mulching).
4. Evaluate water management in a dry climate.
5. Evaluate pest and disease control (natural methods).
6. Develop case studies of successful syntropic gardens in the region.

### Fact-Checking :

- Verification of the content.

## Phase 4  : Knowledge Base Development and Maintenance

### Build Knowledge Base (Integrating AI Features) :

- Choose a suitable platform that supports API integrations and R.A.G. for LLMs and image recognition services.

### Design AI features :

1. LLM-powered Chatbot to answer user questions interactively.
2. Image Uploads for Plant Identification (using Vision models).
3. Prepare for future features like image analysis for garden health assessment.

### Test and Refine Performance :

1. Get general feedback from target audience.
2. Test AI featuresand evaluate the accuracy and helpfulness of the chatbot and plant identification features.
3. Gather user feedback specifically on these AI components.

### Ongoing Maintenance :

1. Keep information up-to-date.
2. Regularly review and update content.
3. Monitor and refine AI performance.

## Develop Solutions for Tinos Island :

1. Water scarcity: Address water-wise gardening techniques, drought-tolerant plants, greywater and blackwater treatment and re-use.
2. Strong winds: Provide guidance on windbreaks and plant selection for windy conditions.
3. Local plant varieties: Test and emphasize the use of native and well-adapted species.
4. Cultural context: Incorporate local traditions and knowledge related to agriculture and gardening.

By following this roadmap and adapting it to the specific context of Tinos, we built a valuable and informative knowledge base that helps people create thriving syntropic gardens.
