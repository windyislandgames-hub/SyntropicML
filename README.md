# SyntropicML
SyntropicML is a knowledge base algorithm that specializes in energy flows, ecosystem succession and regenerative agriculture. The target audience is humans with familiarity with conventional gardening. SyntropicML will be used for building agents that can support decision making, pattern recognition and  predictive modeling. SyntropicML focuses on the following key performance indicator : Biomass production rate, Canopy stratification levels, Root system development, Organic matter content, Soil biodiversity, Water retention capacity, Nutrient cycling efficiency, Carbon sequestration rates, Soil structure improvement, Recovery time after disturbance, Pest/disease resistance, Climate adaptation capacity, System self-maintenance level, Resource use efficiency, Energy flow efficiency, Time to system maturity, Resource input requirements, Maintenance needs, Labor hours required. SyntropicML will focus on the climate of the Cyclades and especially the climate of Tinos Greece and its seasonal cycles, succession stages and long-term ecosystem development.
